	<h1>Visual Communication Design</h1>
	<p>according to <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Visual_communication_design">wiki university</a>...</p>
	<p>Visual Communication Design is a branch of arts comprehending the designed visual communication of ideas. Visual communications design suffuses modern life: signage, books, interactive screens, websites, newspapers, television and more.</p>
<p>
The building blocks of visual communications design include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	Line-the foundation of any design. Line can be mechanical (drawn with a guide, such as a ruler) or organic (drawn freehand).</li>
	<li>
	Shape-any object constructed by lines, whether by a solid or implied line, such as dots or dashes.</li>
	<li>
	Color-as well as filling shapes, color can significantly create or affect the "mood" of a design.</li>
	<li>
	Typography-literally, the use of text, typography affects the mood of a design, much like color, while also controlling the clarity of the intended message.</li>
	<li>
	Layout-"placing into view," the arrangement of the design elements on a page.</li>
	<li>
	Visual Perception-the user's reaction to a design. This can range from simple (meanings of colors and textures, proximity of elements, readability, etc.) to more abstract psychological theories (the Gestalt Principle, the Law of Closure, etc.)</li>
</ul>
